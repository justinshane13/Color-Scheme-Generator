# Color Scheme Generator

## Description

This project is a Color Scheme Generator. It saves designers and developers time by creating color scheme options for them.

## Summary

The site is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The color schemes are generated by making an API call to The Color API. The user selects a starting color and a type of color scheme, and the response from the API is used to populate the color scheme chart. The hex code for each color can then be copied by the user for use in their application.
